## Who I am

I'm an algorithm engineer and my job focuses on robotics and artificial intelligence, mostly working on robot motion control, motion planning, teleoperation and robot learning. And I am committed to making robots more intelligent with artificial intelligence.

## What I do/have done

Currently I am working as an **Algorithm Engineer** for **Omniverse** simulation platform. Based on the **Industrial Metaverse Platform**, the whole processes of industrial production which include requirement, design, development, testing, deployment and operating could be accelerated serval times for high efficiency and more convenience.

In the last 7 years I worked as a **Robot Algorithm Engineer** mainly focused on algorithm development and application but with an **AI Enthusiast** as well. I'm also dedicated to integrating robotics and artificial intelligence to construct an intelligent humanoid robot for users.
