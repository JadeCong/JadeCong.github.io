    publisher: "Journal of Tiangong University"
    releaseDate: "2020-07-01"
    website: "http://tjgydx.scizazhi.com/"
    summary: "Based on the master-manipulatorâ€™s dynamic model, the strategy of the induced feedback force compensation was proposed and a teleoperation experiment was performed. The experimental results showed that the induced feedback force model proposed can well describe the actual induced feedback force."
